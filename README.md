# Sublime Enfocado  
A Sublime Text 4 compatible version of [Enfocado](https://wuelnerdotexe.github.io/enfocado/) theme, if you like it please support the original theme designer.  

## Why?  
Because I wanted to test the theme on a Sublime Text 4 installation but there was no official release for it at the time.  

## How?  
All theme files are build using the [VSCode Theme to Sublime Text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-theme-to-sublime-text) package, using a [Enfocado fork](https://github.com/gustapinto/vscode-enfocado) to match the converter hard-coded default branch.  

## Installation (Linux)
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/gustapinto/sublime-enfocado`  
2. Copy all folder to Sublime Text packages folder with `cp -r Enfocado* ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User/`  
3. Activate the theme and the color schemes!
